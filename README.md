What
---
a11y_experience aims to give examples of common web accessibility problems before they're fixed and after they're fixed to help teams experience the problems different users face when navigating the web.

When navigating to the site, users should be presented with accessible instructions saying that the form they're about to use is inaccessible.  With a screen reader, the user can then experience a badly designed form. With the click of a button, the user then experiences the same form but with accessible inputs.

ally_experience follows Section 508/WCAG Level 2 guidelines for the accessibility of the site.


Roadmap
---
1. Show a basic accessible form
2. Create a new page that has an inaccessible form and a link to the accessible form
3. Add more inaccessible/accessible element pairs
4. Experiment to see if there's a way to mimick screen reader behavior for both the inaccessible form and the accessible form so that the inputs are hidden but their outputs are readable on the screen.

Contributing

1. If you see a missing accessiblity criteria (508 or WCAG 2), add a form element that shows how it can be broken or fixed
